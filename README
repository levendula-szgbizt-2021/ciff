CIFF
====

PREREQUISITES: you need jpeglib to build ciff

This simple C library implements a parser for the CIFF format described
in docs/spec.txt.

To build the library and the cli binary, simply execute

	$ make

To install them on your system under PREFIX (/usr/local by default),
issue

	# make install

There are more targets; examine the Makefile if you are interested.
You may also remove both the library and the binary installed to PREFIX
by

	# make deinstall
