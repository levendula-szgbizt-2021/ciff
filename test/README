Simple test suite for the CIFF parser and converter utility.

To run all tests, simply execute

	$ make

If you would like to see what is being compared, set VERBOSE to 1, ie

	$ make VERBOSE=1


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files in this directory:

	fuzz/           fuzzing-related tests' directory

	ready/          prepared inputs for testers with no perl

	gentest         script responsible for generating input CIFF
			files; see `./gentest -h' for usage

	Makefile        minimal Makefile to run all tests with make

	README          this documentation

	test-*          individual tests; they may contain anything, but
			must be executable

	TestUtil.pm     utility Perl module for Perl tests


The Makefile simply executes all files that match the name test-* in the
directory, sequentially. It is the responsibility of the individual
binaries (most likely scripts) to print diagnostics regarding the test
results.
