We have tested the code using custom methods that can be found in the
test directory. Please refer to the short documentation there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fuzzing results
---------------

$ afl-fuzz -i afl_in/ -o afl_out -- ./ciff

has been run: no crashes were found.

(You can verify this by running make from the fuzz directory)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Valgrind
--------

The code has been tested with valgrind for memory leaks.

There are no memory leaks.

Valgrind's logs have been placed in this directory: valgrind.log

which is the output of

	$ valgrind \
	    --leak-check=full \
	    --show-leak-kinds=all \
	    --log-file=valgrind.log -- \
	    ciff -vo/dev/null huflag.ciff
